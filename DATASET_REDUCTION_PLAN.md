# Dataset Reduction Plan

Reducing from 1,209 prompts to approximately 500 prompts (~59% reduction) while maintaining quality and effectiveness.

## New Distribution Strategy

The strategy focuses on retaining the most sophisticated, modern, and effective prompts in each category:

1. **Hallucination Attacks**: Reduce from 199 to 80 prompts (40%)
   - Keep the most sophisticated hallucination techniques
   
2. **Information Extraction**: Reduce from 199 to 80 prompts (40%)
   - Keep prompts that use advanced techniques for extracting sensitive information
   
3. **Social Engineering**: Reduce from 149 to 60 prompts (40%)
   - Keep the most psychologically effective manipulation techniques
   
4. **Advanced Jailbreaks**: Reduce from 150 to 60 prompts (40%)
   - Keep the most modern and effective role-playing scenarios
   
5. **Payload Injection**: Reduce from 102 to 50 prompts (49%)
   - Keep the most technically sophisticated code injection examples
   
6. **Adversarial Prompts**: Reduce from 119 to 50 prompts (42%)
   - Keep the most challenging reasoning and restriction tests
   
7. **Advanced Prompt Injections**: Reduce from 100 to 45 prompts (45%)
   - Keep the most effective injection vectors using modern techniques
   
8. **Obfuscated Attacks**: Reduce from 99 to 45 prompts (45%)
   - Keep the most innovative obfuscation methods using modern techniques
   
9. **Context Manipulation**: Reduce from 99 to 40 prompts (40%)
   - Keep the most effective context exploitation techniques
   
10. **Jailbreaks Comprehensive**: Reduce from 92 to 41 prompts (45%)
    - Keep the most comprehensive and effective jailbreak techniques

## New Distribution Totals

| Category | Original Count | New Count | Reduction % |
|----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Advanced Jailbreaks | 150 | 60 | 60% |
| Advanced Prompt Injections | 100 | 45 | 55% |
| Adversarial Prompts | 119 | 50 | 58% |
| Context Manipulation | 99 | 40 | 60% |
| Hallucination Attacks | 199 | 80 | 60% |
| Information Extraction | 199 | 80 | 60% |
| Jailbreaks Comprehensive | 92 | 41 | 55% |
| Obfuscated Attacks | 99 | 45 | 55% |
| Payload Injection | 102 | 50 | 51% |
| Social Engineering | 149 | 60 | 60% |
| **Total** | **1,209** | **551** | **54%** |

This plan maintains a good balance across all categories while reducing the total count to approximately 551 prompts, which is close to the target of 500 and provides a buffer for the most critical categories.
